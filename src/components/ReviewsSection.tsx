      review: "Paul's place is modern, very clean, well furnished and Netflix crowns it all! The 2 bedroom house is quite spacious and has great light. I loved the fact that Paul has bottled water in the house which is one thing a guest requires as soon as you get to the house. A lot of hosts ignore this. The house is in a quiet area. Paul communicates and responds very fast, which makes booking his place very easy and if you need anything, he responds as fast. He allowed me to book one extra day at the very last minute. He has a great personality and attitude. I would definitely stay at his place any time I am in Kisumu. This has now become my home away from home! Highly recommended."
